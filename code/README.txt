My main.ipynb file contains all the code I used to create my results. To use it, open it as a Jupyter notebook and begin running the cells for the assignment. It is labeled with a functions section and a main section. The main section is where you will enter your image(s) file path(s) and running it will produce the algorithms results to the output file paths specified. To choose the algorithm you want to use uncomment it in the main section. Make sure you run all of the cells in order.
