# Seam Carving

Seam carving is the process of shrinking an image horizontally or vertically by removing seams of an image that have the lowest energy in the image. This preserves the rectangular shape of the image while avoiding jagged artifacts caused by removing columns or rows. This technique was published in a SIGGRAPH paper "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir. In this project I implemented the basic seam carving algorithm and some other processes that build upon it.
